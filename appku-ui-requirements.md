Last updated 10/18/25
## User Interface

- **UI-S1**: Does the Behavior allow the specified user to perform the action and get the results as defined?
- **UI-S2**: Is the spelling & grammar correct?
- **UI-S3**: Are the sizes appropriate for the content?
- **UI-S4**: Is content spaced consistently? Are widgets sized in reasonable conformity?
- **UI-S5**: Does content align and group well together, and are they presented in an organized fashion?
- **UI-S6**: Has all "placeholder" or temporary content been removed?
- **UI-S7**: Are values formatted (such as thousands separators, date dividers, etc.) appropriately based on AppKu standards or as defined by the process owners?
- **UI-S8**: Do the widgets match AppKu style guidelines for UI/UX?
- **UI-S9**: Does it follow the responsiveness style guidelines?

## Brand Alignment

- **UI-BRAND1**: Is the proper logo shown on the app, does it go to the entry screen?
- **UI-BRAND2**: Are the colors consistent with brand colors?
- **UI-BRAND3**: Does the overall look & feel match with the brand & aesthetic?
- **UI-BRAND4**: Are the fonts and colors consistent and matching the proposed design, or spirit thereof?
- **UI-BRAND5**: Is the terminology consistent with the process/brand?

## Secured

- **UI-SEC1**: Do actions that are restricted properly check authorization?
- **UI-SEC2**: Are user accounts that perform actions properly recorded as the actor that performed that action (where such records are kept)?
- **UI-SEC3**: Are actions or content only visible to users that have access to them?
- **UI-SEC4**: If the user attempts to perform an action that requires authentication, and they are not authenticated, they are redirected to a login screen. Relevant APIs return a 401 error code.
- **UI-SEC5**: If the user attempts to perform an action that requires authorization, and they are not authorized, they are shown a helpful message indicating they are forbidden from performing the action. Relevant APIs return a 403 error code.

## User Experience

- **UI-UX1**: Is the implementation approachable from a non-technical, new-user, perspective?
- **UI-UX2**: Is progress and the result of actions clearly indicated?
- **UI-UX3**: Is the primary (or first) input (or action if no input) of the screen/widget focused upon start?
- **UI-UX4**: Does the content resize/scroll with the browser reasonably?
- **UI-UX5**: Does the behavior work rapidly with reasonable speed, accuracy, and visual smoothness (no "jumps", "flashes", "flickers", etc.)?
- **UI-UX6**: Are input fields being validated (or not) for their content, and failures clearly indicated where appropriate?
- **UI-UX7**: Do closable dialogs or sub-sections confirm closing when there are unsaved changes?
- **UI-UX8**: Does the behavior provide awareness of background processes triggered by their actions?
- **UI-UX9**: Are accidental duplicate activations prevented until the original process completes?

## Accessibility

- **UI-ACC1**: Is the behavior keyboard accessible?
- **UI-ACC2**: Are tooltips or instructions available, helpful, and in proper sentence format?
- **UI-ACC3**: Are lists presented in alpha-numeric order (unless otherwise specified)?
- **UI-ACC4**: Is content readable, using underlines only for links, not auto-scrolling (marquee), uses consistent headers & fonts with proper emphasis and italics, and doesn't cause strain to read?
- **UI-ACC5**: Does the behavior operate correctly at slow network speeds?
- **UI-ACC6**: Is the behavior usable for those who have color blindness?
- **UI-ACC7**: Do images include an alt tag that describes what is shown in the image in proper sentence format?
