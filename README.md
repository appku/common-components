# Project Tracking
Anytime you'd like to see how the project is going, it's [available in the projects page](../../projects).
Some repositories may have multiple projects associated, if so, the "primary" project is the project that has the
same name as the repository.

## :zap: Energy Usage
The :zap: energy balance is recorded each billing cycle in the [Custom Properties](../../custom-properties)
of this project.

Additionally, claims of :zap: energy in issue comments are automatically calculated and added to the issue's project 
record (if any). These calculated values are periodically set and should not be changed manually, as they will get
overwritten. Each issue's total claim may span multiple billing periods, but represent a holistic total of the :zap:
energy claimed for that particular effort.
